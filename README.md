# HTML Basics – Paragraph Tags

This project contains an exercise about using paragraph tags (`<p>`) in HTML.

## Task №1

One of the main elements of a webpage is a paragraph. It can be compared to paragraphs in a book — each paragraph starts on a new line. By default, HTML does not add an indentation (red line), but it can be styled later with CSS.

### Example:
```html
<p>
    This is a paragraph 1.
</p>
<p>
    This is a paragraph 2.
</p>
<p>
    This is a paragraph 3.
</p>
